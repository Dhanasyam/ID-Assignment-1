# ID-Assignment-1

This is ID assignment 1.

The purpose of this website is to portray my portfoli website. It will conntain information about my education and the skill I have.

This website can be used by my juniors, future employers, and teachers. They can then know about my skills and life.

In my website the users can understand what all journeys I went through to get into a university in Singapore, the skills and talents I possess, and the type of person I am.
Poeple can also view my instagram, facebook, linkedIn, and twitter in the website.

## Designing process

The Website provides a portfolio website. It has 4 pages, the home page, education page, skill page and a page to contact me. While doing the coding I had problems with css but I researched a lot and understood a lot about css. But the problem that I faced was java script, which still I can't complete. Also I couldn't find the link to my projects before so I could'nt add those.

## Features

1. There is a navigation bar which is linked to each page, so that the user can try to move to different pages.
2. A button is provided in each page to go to next page, for the convienience of the user.
3. All the pages are really clear to the user and is user friendly.
4. All the pages are adapted for different screen sizes.
5. When the user clicks on the logo they are taken back to the home page.
6. There is a contact us page provided at the end of the webpage, where the user can also find my social media accounts.

## Features which can be added

I wanted a switch to open up the menu, because when the user scrolls down they can't see the menu bar, and I also wanted a switch to toggle on dark mode. This can be done using Javascript but I couldn't make that possible.

## Help

Most of the help was from Mrs ONG, which is our ID teacher and she taught me most of the things. But on the session of the Javascript I was absent so I had hard time understanding it. Then I got other help from websites like stack overflow and some youtubers.
