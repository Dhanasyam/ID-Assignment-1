          <h1> Education </h1>
          <p>
              I was born in kerala, India. I studied in India for 12 years in a school called Bhavan's Vidhyashram. But I always wanted to 
              explore new country, new culture, new people and didnt want to be stuck in India forever. So I went to study in Singapore as my
              father works there. So I joined a Polytechnic called Ngee Ann Polytechnic and started my IT course. The only problem that I faced was 
              communication, as I was in a new country people do not understand me and vice versa. But I managed to be a part
              of Singapore and made some friends. The only dissapointment is that I didnt get a friend who comes from the same country as me. 
              Now I am doing the second semester in Ngee Ann Polytechnic and it is awesome. The campus was really amazing and my classmates and 
              teacher were really welcoming. After I get my diploma I plan to take my National Service(NS). The National service should be taken by
              all the Permenant residents and citizens in Singapore, so as I was a PR I also have to do it. When my NS is done I plan to take 
              Compupter Science in any University. My Ambition is to become a Software Engineer.
