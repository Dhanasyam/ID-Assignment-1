            I was born in Kerala, India. I studied in India for 12 years in a school called Bhavan's Vidhyashram. But I always wanted to
            explore new country, new culture, new people and didn’t want to be stuck in India forever. So, I went to study in Singapore as my
            father works there. So, I joined a Polytechnic called Ngee Ann Polytechnic and started my IT course. The only problem that I faced was
            communication, as I was in a new country people do not understand me and vice versa. But I managed to be a part
            of Singapore and made some friends. <br>
            <br>The only disappointment is that I didn’t get a friend who comes from the same country as me.
            Now I am doing the second semester in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, and it is awesome. The campus was amazing and my classmates and
            teachers were really welcoming. After I get my diploma, I plan to take my National Service (NS). The National service should be taken by
            all the Permanent residents and citizens in Singapore, so as I was a PR, I also have to do it. When my NS is done, I plan to take
            Computer Science in any University. My Ambition is to become a Software Engineer.
