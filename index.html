            "Learning new topics and subjects has always had a special interest in my 
            life especially when it comes to subjects that I like. I am a friendly individual who likes 
            and looks forward to meeting new people and explore the culture of Singapore.
            I am a team worker and I always care for the well being of my teammates no matter what. I enjoy
            watching thriller movies and I hope one day I can come up with a banger of a story. I also hope that 
            I can contribute to society well and make myself useful for everyone around me."
